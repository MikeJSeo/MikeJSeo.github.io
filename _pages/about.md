# About

I am currently a Ph.D. student in Biostatistics at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, advised by Dr. Orestis Efthimiou [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.gr/citations?user=Vnips7cAAAAJ&hl=en)].

My research interests include Bayesian methods, (network) meta-analysis, and machine learning.
