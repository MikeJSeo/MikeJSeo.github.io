# About

I am currently a Ph.D. student in Biostatistics at the [Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine](https://ispm.unibe.ch/), University of Bern, advised by Dr. Orestis Efthimiou [[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.gr/citations?user=Vnips7cAAAAJ&hl=en)]

My research interests include Bayesian methods, (network) meta-analysis, and machine learning. 

I received my M.S. degree in Statistics at Stanford University and B.S. degree in Statistics at Duke University.
