# About

I received my PhD in Biostatistics and Epidemiology from the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, under the supervision of Dr. Orestis Efthimiou. My doctoral research focused on developing evidence synthesis methodologies to support precision medicine and personalized treatment selection.

I leverage causal inference, indirect treatment comparisons (ITC), and network meta-analyses (NMA) to derive insights from clinical datasets.
