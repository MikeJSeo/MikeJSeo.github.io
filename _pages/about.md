# About

I received my PhD in Biostatistics and Epidemiology at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, advised by Dr. Orestis Efthimiou. My thesis was on evidence synthesis methods for personalizing the choice of treatment.

I use methods in causal inference, indirect treatment comparisons (ITC), and network meta-analyses (NMA) to derive insights from clinical datasets.
