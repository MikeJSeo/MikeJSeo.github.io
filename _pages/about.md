# About

I received my PhD in Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, advised by Dr. Orestis Efthimiou. My thesis was on evidence synthesis methods for personalizing the choice of treatment.

For my daily work, I apply statistical methods such as indirect treatment comparison, network meta-analysis, and causal inference on clinical datasets.
